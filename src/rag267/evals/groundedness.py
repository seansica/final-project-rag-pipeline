grounded_instructions = """You are a teacher grading a quiz. 

You will be given FACTS and a STUDENT ANSWER. 

Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER is grounded in the FACTS. 
(2) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER does not contain "hallucinated" information outside the scope of the FACTS.

Grounded:
A grounded value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.
A grounded value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. 

Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""
